        <h1>Top PvP Classes for The War Within 11.0.7</h1>
        <h2>World of Warcraft's PvP landscape is constantly shifting, with every patch comes changes to the balance
            of power between classes. Here are the top-performing classes and specs for PvP in the current patch.</h2>
        <h3>1. <strong>Discipline Priest</strong></h3>
        <p>Discipline Priests excel in PvP due to their ability to heal and deal damage simultaneously. They rely on
            managing Atonement, where healing spells heal allies and simultaneously deal damage to enemies. This spec is
            extremely strong in arena settings where both offensive and defensive support is needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High utility, strong healing, and damage from <strong>Atonement.</strong>
                Ability to outplay
                enemy healers with damage and crowd control. <strong>Psychic Scream</strong> and <strong>Mind
                    Dominate</strong> are powerful CC's and need to be used regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires a high skill cap to maximize effectiveness, vulnerable to heavy
                burst damage and crowd control. It is difficult to maintain DPS (DamagePerSecond) while keeping allys
                healed.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Builds</strong> I am currently using Oracle for 3's and BG content. I also use it for
                2's matches with oppoents being double DPS. The Voidweaver build with mindbender is best when doing 2's
                matches against opposing teams that have a healer, as the mind bender build can preserve mana more
                effectively while the Oracle build can pump out more heals per second (HPS).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. <strong>Balance Druid</strong></h3>
        <p>Balance Druids are a versatile ranged class with great mobility and strong burst potential. Their ability to
            deal AoE damage and spread crowd control through <strong>Solar Beam</strong> and <strong>Entangling
                Roots</strong> makes them highly effective in both arenas and battlegrounds.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High burst potential with <strong>Incarnation:Chosen of Elune</strong> and
                <strong>Starsurge</strong>, strong utility with
                roots and AoE damage. Has the advantage of starting combat in catform while in <strong>Stealth</strong>,
                catching opponents off guard. Has <strong>Bear Form</strong>, which gives the advantage of
                <strong>Bash</strong> and <strong>Frenzied Regeneration.</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Squishy, requires good positioning and awareness to maximize effectiveness.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on maximizing <strong>Solar Eclipse</strong> for increased damage
                from <strong>Starsurge</strong>. Use <strong>Moonfire</strong> and <strong>Sunfire</strong> to spread
                damage and keep pressure on enemies. Incorporate <strong>Solar Beam</strong> for interrupting enemy
                casters and <strong>Typhoon</strong> to peel off melee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. <strong>Retribution Paladin</strong></h3>
        <p>Retribution Paladins are a powerhouse in PvP, capable of high burst damage and strong utility. Their ability
            to heal themselves with <strong>Word of Glory</strong> and sustain through defensive cooldowns makes them
            formidable opponents in arenas.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High burst potential with <strong>Ashes of the Wake</strong> and
                <strong>Hammer of Light</strong> while casting fully charged <strong>Templar's Verdict</strong>,
                self-sustain with <strong>Word of Glory</strong>, and strong crowd control.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable when cooldowns are down, susceptible to crowd control and
                interrupts.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on using the passive version of <strong>Avenging Wrath</strong> by
                casting <strong>Ashes of the Wake</strong> for burst damage during
                key moments. Utilize <strong>Divine Shield</strong> and <strong>Bubble Hearth</strong> for
                survivability. Keep up with <strong>Judgment</strong> and <strong>Templar's Verdict</strong> for
                consistent damage output.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. <strong>Marksmanship Hunter</strong></h3>
        <p>Marksmanship Hunters are a ranged DPS spec that excels in both burst damage and kiting. Their ability to
            control the fight from range while maintaining high uptime on damage through <strong>Chimaera Shot</strong>
            and <strong>Aimed Shot</strong> makes them highly effective in PvP.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High burst potential with <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> and <strong>Aimed
                    Shot</strong>, excellent mobility, and great range.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to heavy melee pressure and crowd control.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on maximizing burst with <strong>Trueshot</strong> and using
                <strong>Aimed Shot</strong> for hard-hitting damage. Use <strong>Exhilaration</strong> to sustain
                yourself and <strong>Hunter's Mark</strong> to increase damage on your target.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. <strong>Beast Mastery Hunter</strong></h3>
        <p>Beast Mastery Hunters are strong PvP contenders due to their pet utility and versatility. Their ability to
            have their pets attack from afar while maintaining their own mobility is perfect for both 2v2 and 3v3
            scenarios.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High sustained damage from pets, mobility, great for kiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Pets can be easily killed, lower burst potential compared to other ranged
                classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on maximizing pet damage with <strong>Dire Beast</strong>,
                <strong>Call of the Wild</strong>, and
                <strong>Bestial Wrath</strong> for increased damage output. Use <strong>Kill Command</strong> frequently
                to maintain constant pressure.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>6. <strong>Windwalker Monk</strong></h3>
        <p>Windwalker Monks excel in PvP thanks to their high mobility, crowd control, and sustained damage. Their
            ability to quickly move around the battlefield and deal with enemies through high-damage abilities like
            <strong>Fists of Fury</strong> and <strong>Rising Sun Kick</strong> make them deadly in close-quarters
            combat.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Great mobility, high sustained damage, strong crowd control with <strong>Leg
                    Sweep</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to being kited or stunned.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on utilizing <strong>Fists of Fury</strong> for AoE damage,
                <strong>Rising Sun Kick</strong> for burst, and <strong>Leg Sweep</strong> for crowd control. Maintain
                uptime with <strong>Touch of Death</strong> for finishing blows.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. <strong>Mistweaver Monk</strong></h3>
        <p>Mistweaver Monks are hybrid healers in PvP that can use a combination of powerful heals, damage, and
            crowd control. Their ability to transition between healing and dealing damage makes them unique in any
            PvP setting.</p>
        <ul>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Focus on using <strong>Soothing Mist</strong> for healing while using
                <strong>Fistweaving</strong> for increased damage and healing. Utilize <strong>Zen Pulse</strong> for
                AoE healing and <strong>Life Cocoon</strong> for big heals.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. <strong>Affliction Warlock</strong></h3>
        <p>Affliction Warlocks excel at controlling enemies with damage over time (DoT) effects. They can pressure
            enemies over long fights and use crowd control to lock down enemies while dealing substantial damage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High sustained damage with <strong>Agony</strong> and <strong>Unstable
                    Affliction</strong>, excellent crowd control with <strong>Fear</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to burst damage if not well-positioned.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> The Affliction Warlock focuses on maximizing sustained damage through
                key abilities like <strong>Agony</strong> <strong>Unstable Affliction</strong> and
                <strong>Corruption</strong>, while maintaining crowd control with <strong>Fear</strong> and
                <strong>Mortal Coil.</strong> Survivability is enhanced through <strong>Drain Life</strong> and
                <strong>Unending Resolve</strong> for defensive cooldowns.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9. <strong>Frost Mage</strong></h3>
        <p>Frost Mages excel at controlling the battlefield with powerful crowd control, kiting enemies, and consistent
            burst damage. Their primary focus is on slowing enemies while dealing damage with abilities like
            <strong>FrostBolt</strong> and <strong>IceLance.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong control abilities like <strong>Frost Nova</strong>
                and
                <strong>Polymorph</strong> provide excellent crowd control, freezing or incapacitating enemies for easy
                follow-ups. Excellent survivability, <strong>Ice Block</strong> and <strong>Blink</strong> allow them
                to escape danger and reset fights quickly.
                High burst potential when paired with <strong>Frozen Orb</strong> and <strong>Icy
                    Veins</strong>, Frost Mages can deal significant burst damage.
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to melee, Frost Mages struggle against
                high-mobility melee classes who can close the gap quickly.
                Low sustained damage: Unlike other specs, Frost Mages are highly reliant on burst
                phases, which can leave them underwhelming over long periods.</li>

            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong>
                Key abilities: <strong>Frostbolt</strong>, <strong>Ice Lance</strong>, <strong>Frozen
                    Orb</strong>, and <strong>Icy Veins</strong> are the backbone of Frost Mage damage.
                Cooldowns like <strong>Ice Block</strong> are great for defensive play and <strong>Blizzard</strong>
                for area control
                Talent Choices: <strong>Glacial Spike</strong> for strong burst damage and
                <strong>Shatter</strong> for maximizing <strong>Ice Lance</strong> damage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>10. <strong>Fury Warrior</strong></h3>
        <p>Fury Warriors excel at dealing sustained damage with rapid attacks using two-handed weapons. Their aggressive
            playstyle is centered around high burst damage, mobility, and high uptime on their target with abilities
            like <strong>Rampage</strong> and <strong>Colossus Smash</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High burst damage with <strong>Rampage</strong> and <strong>Colossus
                    Smash</strong> makes them a constant threat. Their mobility through <strong>Charge</strong> and
                <strong>Heroic Leap</strong> allows them to close gaps quickly and maintain pressure. They also have
                strong defensive abilities like <strong>Die by the Sword</strong> and <strong>Enraged
                    Regeneration</strong>, providing great survivability in intense situations.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Fury Warriors are vulnerable to crowd control and can struggle when locked
                down. They also rely heavily on key cooldowns like <strong>Rampage</strong> and <strong>Battle
                    Cry</strong>, making them less effective when these abilities are unavailable. Their sustained
                damage can be lower than other classes when not using cooldowns effectively.</li>

            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Key abilities: <strong>Rampage</strong>, <strong>Colossus
                    Smash</strong>, and <strong>Execute</strong> are central to Fury Warrior's damage. Cooldowns like
                <strong>Battle Cry</strong> and <strong>Die by the Sword</strong> are essential for maximizing both
                offense and defense. Talent Choices: <strong>Sudden Death</strong> to increase Execute damage and
                <strong>War Machine</strong> to boost mobility and rage generation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>11. <strong>Havoc Demon Hunter</strong></h3>
        <p>Havoc Demon Hunters are fast, mobile, and deal high sustained damage while being incredibly difficult to pin
            down. Their playstyle focuses on hitting hard with abilities like <strong>Chaos Strike</strong> and
            <strong>Eye Beam</strong> while utilizing incredible mobility to stay on top of their targets.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Havoc Demon Hunters are incredibly mobile with abilities like
                <strong>Vengeful Retreat</strong> and <strong>Fel Rush</strong> allowing them to close gaps or escape
                danger. Their damage is highly consistent thanks to <strong>Chaos Strike</strong> and their ability to
                quickly reset abilities like <strong>Eye Beam</strong>. They also have strong self-healing capabilities
                through <strong>Spectral Sight</strong> and <strong>Leech</strong>.</li>

            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> While they have high mobility, Havoc Demon Hunters are somewhat squishy and
                can struggle when caught in heavy crowd control. They rely on key cooldowns like
                <strong>Metamorphosis</strong> to maximize their damage, making them less effective when those abilities
                are unavailable. Their sustained damage output can also feel lacking in longer fights if cooldowns are
                not properly managed.</li>

            <li><strong>Current Build:</strong> Key abilities: <strong>Chaos Strike</strong>, <strong>Eye Beam</strong>,
                and <strong>Blade Dance</strong> are central to Havoc Demon Hunter's burst and sustained damage.
                Cooldowns like <strong>Metamorphosis</strong> and <strong>The Hunt</strong> increase overall damage and
                survivability. Talent Choices: <strong>First Blood</strong> for single-target damage, <strong>Unbound
                    Chaos</strong> for AoE burst, and <strong>Fury of the Illidari</strong> for additional burst
                potential.</li>
        </ul>
