            <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>

            <p>We hold these truths to be <b>self-evident</b>, that <strong>all men</strong> are created equal, that
                they are <i>endowed by their Creator</i> with certain unalienable Rights, that <em>among these are Life,
                    Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</em>.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
                among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of
                Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
                and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
                such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed,
                will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
                accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
                sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
                long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce
                them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to
                provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies;
                and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The
                history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all
                having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let
                Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
            <h2> Problems With the King</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
                <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended
                    in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly
                    neglected to attend to them.</li>
                <li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
                    people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them
                    and formidable to tyrants only.</li>
                <li>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
                    depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
                    measures.</li>
